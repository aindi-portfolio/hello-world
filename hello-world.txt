Hello worldly beings. Please check out my poem.
It references certain colors that we have heard
throughout our childhood. I've never reserched on this
poem before.

A lot of collaboration and brainstorming was required
to achieve such a splendid poem full of hope
and butt-clenching rollercoster of emotions.
